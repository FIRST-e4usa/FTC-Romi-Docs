Computer Setup
==============

The FTC Romi app can be either used with a real Android phone **or** a computer.
If you wish to use a phone rather than a computer, follow `this guide <phone.html>`_ instead.

Emulator
--------
You will first need to install an **emulator** on your computer to run the FTC Romi app.
An emulator is a program that basically "pretends" to be an Android phone.

We recommend an emulator called **BlueStacks 4**.
To install BlueStacks 4, navigate to the website's download page (https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) and scroll down to BlueStacks 4:

**Note: it is important you download BlueStacks 4 rather than BlueStacks 5, because BlueStacks 5 does not work with a gamepad.**

For Windows, you probably want to download **Nougat 64 bit**.

After downloading the installer, open it and click through it until BlueStacks 4 is installed.
The program contains a few advertisements, so be sure to avoid clicking those.
