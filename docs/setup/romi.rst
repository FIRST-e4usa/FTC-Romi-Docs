Romi Setup
==========

Hardware and Assembly
---------------------
The Romi robot requires certain hardware and assembly instructions to start using.
The FRC software documentation already has a comprehensive guide on the this process.
Follow this guide and then return here:

`Romi Hardware & Assembly <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/hardware.html>`_

Keep in mind that for running FTC Romi, you will also need an Android phone to run the FTC app on.
To control the robot, you will need a wired gamepad and an On The Go cable to connect the gamepad to the phone.
These are items typically used on full-sized FTC robots:

- `Logitech Gamepad <https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000110-Gamepad-F310/dp/B003VAHYQY>`_
- `Micro USB OTG cable <https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Adapter-Samsung-Controller-Android/dp/B00N9S9Z0G/>`_

Imaging
-------
After setting up your Romi you will need install and configure software on this.
Once again, the FRC software documentation has a guide that explains this very clearly.
Follow this guide and then return here:
